Text For Teh Win

A stupid name for a simple thing.

Edit text from any GUI object in Windows via a text editor 
(currently hard-coded to gvim).

Run tftw.exe.
Hit Windows-v to edit the current panel in vim. Hit Windows-z to exit tftw.

This currently has basic funcionality.
There is no installer, no customization, and no post-hooks.
