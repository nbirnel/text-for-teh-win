Text For Teh Win

A stupid name for a simple thing.

Edit text from any GUI object in Windows via a text editor 
(currently hard-coded to gvim, but can be configured in 
%USERPROFILE%\.config\text-for-teh-win\config.ini).

Run tftw.exe.
Hit Windows-v to edit the current panel in your chosen editor. Hit Windows-z to exit tftw.

This currently has basic funcionality.
There is no installer, no editor customization, and no post-hooks.
